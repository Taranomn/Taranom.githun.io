            <h2>Education</h2>
            <p>Seneca - CPP(Computer Programming)</p>
            <p>2025</p>
            <p>Seneca College's Computer Programming program has been a life-changing event that has improved not just my technical proficiency but also my problem-solving capabilities. I have been engrossed in a broad curriculum as a student in the Computer Programming (CPP) program, covering everything from basic programming languages like Java, HTML, JavaScript, CSS, C++, and C to more complex topics like web development, database management, and software design patterns.</p>

            <p>I have applied academic knowledge in relevant ways throughout my studies by working on real-world difficulties through practical, hands-on initiatives. Among these projects have been the creation of powerful software programs, dynamic websites, and databases with effective data storage and retrieval systems. My coding skills have become more solid with each project, and I've learned the value of clear, maintainable code and productive teamwork.</p>
                
            <p>My education has placed a strong emphasis on important soft skills like communication, teamwork, and time management in addition to technical talents. These abilities have been critical to my growth both personally and professionally since they enable me to communicate difficult concepts clearly and work with colleagues on a variety of initiatives.</p>
                
                <p>I am excited to advance in the technology business with my technical expertise, problem-solving skills, and never-ending thirst for knowledge as I near the completion of my degree in 2025. My objective is to make a positive impact on cutting-edge software solutions that are widely accessible, user-friendly, and efficient.</p>
                
                <p>My degree in computer programming has equipped me for a successful career in technology by fusing technical skill with a solid ethical foundation. Developing software that improves daily life and advances the digital world is how I hope to make a big difference in this field.</p>
